## UVA Electives Oracle (www.yougao.dev/UVA-Electives-Oracle/)
This project is designed to gather data from a Student Information System API and process it to display a specific set of classes.

The technical motivation of the project was wanting to develop '**SPAs (Singe Page Applications)**' that build their pages using '**AJAX/Async API**' calls. Additionally, I aimed to experiment with popular frameworks and libraries such as ''**Angular, React, and Vue.js**'. The primary inspiration for this project was my desire to create a site where users could easily view all available non-traditional degree courses offered each semester.
